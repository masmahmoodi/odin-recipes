            Assemble the Dumplings:
            - Take a dumpling or wonton wrapper and spoon a small amount of the meat filling onto the center.
            - Moisten the edges of the wrapper with water to help with sealing.
            - Fold the wrapper in half to create a triangle, then pinch and seal the edges together. You can also fold the corners to create a more elaborate shape.
        </li>
        <li>Steam the Dumplings:
            - Arrange the filled dumplings in a steamer basket lined with parchment paper or cabbage leaves to prevent sticking.
            - Place the steamer basket over a pot of boiling water, ensuring the water does not touch the dumplings.
            - Steam the dumplings for about 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through and tender.
